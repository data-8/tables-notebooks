Data Science Tables Demos using a trial jupyter hub
</h1>

Tables provides a simple dataframe abstraction in python tailored for
use in Jupyter notebooks.  It is simpler than Pandas and R, allowing 
intuition to be carried over from spreadsheets.
<p>
This repo provides a set of demonstration examples hosted on the Berkeley data
science education stack
